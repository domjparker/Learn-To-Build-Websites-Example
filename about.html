            Dominic on Waiheke Island, just off the east coast of Auckland
          </h2>
          <p>
            Dominic is a web developer who immigrated to the United States 6
            years ago and lives in Washington with his American wife and 2 boys.
            He would like to return to New Zealand on vacation to visit one of
            these beautiful beaches, but unfortunately covid quarantine
            requirements mean this won't happen for a wee while longer. It has
            been 2 and a half years since he has taken his family to visit.
          </p>
